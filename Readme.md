# Tittle : Apple leaf disease classification

### The main goal is "Building a web app for Apple leaf disease classification using Deep Neural Networks " 

The Project consisting of 'apple_leaf_diseses_multiclass_classification_fastai_Resnet18_deployment.ipynb' jupyter note book 
and folder 'Web_app" which is consisting supporting files for buiding the web app for Apple leaf disease classification with pretrained resnet18 model using fastai library on top of Pytorch.

The file '.ipynb' file consisting of the code and necessary guidelines to build the web app and The Folder 'Web_app' consisiting train.py file includes train() method for constucting and training the resnet18.The reuirement.txt consisting consisting packages needed. index.html file is to interact with model i.e through the html page one can pass the path of an image as input and can get the classification of the apple leaf disease.
